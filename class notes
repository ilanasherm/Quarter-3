class-In object-oriented programming , a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object . 
Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.


super clas/parent class- A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). 
The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).


sub class- Subclasses, also referred to as derived classes, heir classes, or child classes, 
are classes that inherit one or more language entities from another class/classes.


reuseablity- Code reusability is the capacity to repurpose pre-existing code when developing new software applications. 
Ideally, code reuse should be easy to implement, and any stable, functional code could freely be reused when building a new software app
